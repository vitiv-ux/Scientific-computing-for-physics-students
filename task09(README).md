# PARALLELIZATION WITH CPU 
I uploaded two files in which i used MPI and openMP separatelly. Both the codes give as output the time and relative error associated with the measure. In particular it is possible to observe that the time needed  for parallel computing is bigger than the Serial one for less than roughly a million elements inside the array. The error associated to the measure is instead much smaller in the parallel case, as the main source of error comes  from the fact that in the serial case i'm adding the same small value to a value that is bigger and bigger. At a certain point the value i'm adding are so close to the last bits of the sum that it loses informations and  reach an error bigger than 100%. Instead, in the parallel case the error is much less as the sum is splitted, so smaller values are added to smaller values and then few big values are added together.
