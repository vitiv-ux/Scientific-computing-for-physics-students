# How far is the first integral from the analitical solution / How can you reduce the relative  error / Minimum relative error achieved?

the relative error obtained is 0.0000000085781109, this value can be reduced by increasing the decimal values of PI that you give as input. In fact, giving PI with 16 decimals value the program gives
0.0000000000000000. It is important to observe that the input value is used from both the methods to calculate the integrals. I was expecting that other methods to reduce the errors are to 
increase the maximum subdivion of the intervall or to reduce the tollerances of relative and absolute errors inside the function gsl_integration_qags() but instead i observed a constant relative error 0.0010051200205299.  

# python integral
importing the vectors to python and  using  the trapezoid function to calculate the integral, the result is: 1.8904982754200002, which is different from the analitical one: 1.9052379044630752.
In this case the number of points is 10. To increase the precision it possible to increase the number of point. For 10 points a relative error of 0.0067297668 is achieved. For 100 points 0.00094116936. For 1000 points the error is slightly worse than before (counterituitive as i was expecting better result with more points) 0.0010045218153007518. At this point i considered the precision of the intervals. As the python code is using the output file generated by c code i executed the file with 0 and 1,5707963267948965 as intervals. Now with 1000 points the relative error in the python code is: 0.00000020918.
