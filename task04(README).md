# How far is the first integral from the analitical solution / How can you reduce the relative  error / Minimum relative error achieved?

the relative error obtained is 0.0000000085781109, this value can be reduced by increasing the decimal values of PI that you give as input. In fact, giving PI with 16 decimals value the program gives
0.0000000000000000. It is important to observe that the input value is used from both the methods to calculate the integrals. 

# python integral
importing the vectors to python and  using  the trapezoid function to calculate the integral, the result is: 1.8904982754200002, which is different from the analitical one: 1.9052379044630752. In particular, the 
absolute error is 0.01473962904307502.
