In your life, it might happen that you choose to follow a course on scientific computing, and the first task will be to write a Markdown on how to install AlmaLinux 9 using Docker. Don't worry, follow these instructions and you'll be set up in no time. For those of you who are completelly new to these arguments i also leave a link for a Markdouwn guide on GitHub -> [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

## Introduction
Before continuing with the steps to complete the task, let's understand what Docker is.
Docker is a popular open-source software that uses operating-system-level virtualization to run applications in isolated environments called containers. Docker containers are an extension of OS containers. Docker supports both Linux and Windows containers. It is possible to use Docker with Linux containers on Windows and MacOS systems thanks to virtualization techniques (information taken from [wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker).\
As we will see We will use Docker to install Almalinux 9 on Windows. 

### 1 INSTALL DOCKER
The first step is to download Docker from theyr official site, you  can find it [here](https://www.docker.com/).

Move over the "Download Docker Desktop" button and choose the Windows option. The Download should start automatically. At the end of the download run the downloaded file and wait for the installation.\
At the end of the Installation it will ask you to restart  Windows. 
The program will now ask you to create an account (or you can use the GitHub account that you should have  from the beginning of this course) and then you're read to go.
