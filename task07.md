# DESCRIPTION
In this file i proceded with the daxpy operation using gsl library in C. I made a function to which you can pass the values and it will return the vector sum (x*a + y).
For the unit testing i made 4 simple tests: checking that the result is correct by passing known values and checking (with assert) that the result is correct. At the same way i tested if the function 
also works with empty arrays, with negative values and with all zeroes values.
